Question: Could you become immune to the venom of a relatively less dangerous snake like a copperhead by repeated exposure?
">>4102440
Agree with this. You can tell he would rather be a finance bro or a vlogger but he doesn't really have the charisma or clout for either. He could probably carve out a vlogging niche though. A lot of people like watching mundanity.

Either way you nailed it with
> he doesnt really have anything else going for him, so its either be a Reptile Guy that does Reptile Stuff forever or get a real job."
">>4102478
Some dude claims to be immune to black mamba venom through repeated exposure, so yeah sure maybe.
That having been said, apparently repeated expose to spitting cobra venom can give you hypersensitivity to it and can actually result in anaphylaxis in the event of a bite, so on the other hand maybe not."
">>4102492

the black mamba dude doesn't just claim, does he? He straight up gets bitten on camera and is chilling iirc."
Anybody here have a herpstat? Does it have any energy benefits or is it just more organized than 4 ugly thermostats?

Yes
>Why aren't humans counted as Afrotherians?
Primates are their own thing
>Are you telling me Asian Elephants aren't related to African Elephants?
They are, just not as closely as you’d think
>Someone give me the Q R D on the Afrotheria.
Afrotheria including both elephants and golden moles might seem weird until you look at another group like Ferae that has pangolins, tigers and seals or Euungulata that has horses, pigs and whales together"
">>4102144
>is the afrotheria classification legit
straight up bruh no cap
>Why aren't humans counted as Afrotherians?
only black people who identify with animal spirits can be counted as afrotherians. if you're white you're just called a furry.
>Are you telling me Asian Elephants aren't related to African Elephants?
yakub separated them enough that you wouldn't be confused but no so much that they wouldn't both be elephants"
">>4102144
>Is the Afrotheria classification legit?
One definitely wonders. It's a pretty diverse group.

>Are you telling me Asian Elephants aren't related to African Elephants?
The fuck? Where'd you get that idea? Sirenians are Afrotheres also and half the species are from the Americas.

>>4102216
>They are, just not as closely as you’d think
This is wrong. Asian and African Elephants are pretty closely related."
"Do you think dogs forget about old their owners after a while? That as long as they never see them, smell them, or visit their old home, they'd forget they ever cared?

What's the best way to minimize their suffering if you're going away forever, with no chance of return? Just have someone pick them up and never look back?"
">>4102115
Looking online most sources say dogs don't ever truly forget their owners. Through anecdotle evidence like videos of dogs enthusiasticaly greeting owners returning from years of military service and my own experience of leaving for months and returning back home to be greeted by my dog.
In both these cases however the dog was usually being taken care of by someone they already also knew like a relative of the owner so its possible they might forget old owners when introduced to new environments or maybe only remember when they come in contact with old owners.
Hopefully this info doesn't hurt too much, it sounds like you might be making a very difficult choice."
"i got one of my dogs for $20 from a crackhead looking woman
i asked her where he was from and said she got him from someone else who wasn't taking care of him properly but he didn't get along with her kids or dogs or something i forget
i half believed her idk maybe he was stolen but he looked in emaciated and generally nervous and rough shape so i didn't really care where he come from i just wanted to get him out of the situation
he bonded to me extremely quickly like overnight and eventually healed up and house trained and turned into a great healthy happy companion
many years of me owning him i was walking him around in the city and suddenly this man was running up to me ""that's my dog ! omg""
normally i would have not really believed him but my dog, who is normally aloof to strangers, was acting super bouncy excited tail wagging whining like he 100% knew the guy
i was super worried he would want him back but he just told me a bit of his sad addict backstory how he lost his super expensive puppy and that he was glad to know his dog was in good hands :(
i think my dog was happy to see his old friend but equally happy he going home with me
i donno if what he said about the price of his puppy was true but that was the smartest, healthiest dog i've ever had
he would run and jump around like a puppy until the day he seized and died around the age of 20"
">>4102475
you're a good guy anon"
">>4102475
As long as he was happy, it doesn't seem like they actively remember in day to day life, so if you weren't coming back period (ie: you were dead) they'd never feel it for more than a few days."

">>4102118
I guess so? Young pads have leaves on each pore, I assume the thorns are like with other plants, like with citrus every leaf has a thorn at the base, the cactus thorns are at the base of the leaf and the leaves grow from a big fat stem. They don’t do much and they tend to all fall off, they seem to be almost completely vestigial."
">>4102153
ooo, yeah, those things, yeah I know what you're talking about now. Yeah, strange, but still fascinating thing about Opuntias."
">>4102153
Cacti spines are leaves, just modified ones. If you observe closely enough, the young leaves are actually coming out from the same spot as the spines do, ""under"" or ""from"" the areola (which is actually a ridiculously short branch).
This distinction seems useless, but if you look closely at any cactus-like Euphorbia with leaves (like an E. trigona) you'll notice the difference. Euphorbias' thorns are more like the citrus thorns, where they form a part of the bark/stem itself."
"My lavender seedlings keep sprouting, live for two or three days, and suddenly shrivel in a day and die.
Does this mean I'm watering them too much?"
">>4102156
Cacti and Euphorbias have both have spines, which are modified leaves. There are no species with thorns (modified stems) afaik.
Citrus has thorns.

"Fish bros, I recently went to the ""brick and mortar"" location of an online fish seller.

If are in the tropical fish hobby, this is a seller that you have heard about about and have likely perused their online store for fish to buy. Based on Google search results, I'd put them in the top 20. I may or may have not increased that number to avoid getting sued. But I promise: you have heard of them. They are a big name with a big online presence.

Anyway, the store was fucking disgusting. Loads of dust over merchandise, used crap laying everywhere (not even cleaned - it's just laying out gathering bacteria) . It got worse when I looked at their livestock, which is their bread and butter at least online.

The care conditions of their fish seem highly suspect. Many of specimens looked stressed and unhealthy. Crowded. Many specimens in tanks were ""unmarked"", probably the last of their stock, wallowing in their loneliness surrounded by new stock of different species. Many tanks looked questionable, I wouldn't want anything like that in my own tanks. Think of the disease.

Their bettas, for example, looked miserable. I kid you not, the ones at the Petco near me looked 10x more active and colorful. And I hate Petco.

Worse was the specimen in the picture I provided. This large fish had visible funguses on its skin (look near its upper dorsal fin), and I think has been blinded because of negligence. It made me feel gross seeing this. If this is out on its sale floor, what does this say about its other livestock its selling? Would you buy a fish that kept specimens like this?"
"Also, while it isn't obvious on their website, Aqua Imports also sells reptiles. It's a fraction of their livestock but still.

Many of their specimens don't seem happy. I know in theory pet stores are supposed to be temporary homes for pets, but they 3 bearded dragons in what may been a 40 gallon or something. Felt super crowded."
"And someone is going to hurt themselves there, employee or otherwise. I alluded to this earlier but things seem cluttered at Aqua Imports. Someone is going to trip and eat shit and sue them."
"Anybody who imports wild fish like this sacrifices their values. It's a fucked up part of the hobby. If you don't like it, only buy TR from breeders.

I'll name my shitty local store. It's The Wet Spot. Massive amount of turnover for insane wild specimens. Browse the store and you're guaranteed to find dead fish, it's just the way it goes when you import like that."
">>4102453
TR? Sorry, what does that mean, anon?

I recently checked out a ton of LFS in my area. Aqua Imports was by far the most questionable. I found an excellent which is probably going to by my ""go to"". Healthy livestock, engaging employees... clean. My point is that I enjoy knowing not all places are evil/dirty/horrible."
